# Fleet
[Fleet](https://warm-brook-93750.herokuapp.com/) is a commercial application that allows the user to easily keep records of their fleet vehicles. Upon creating an account, the user can add as many vehicles to their collection as they would like. There the software provides easy to use maintenance tracking, with records of who and when the vehicles were used last. Most importantly, we're making the world a better place.
